        <!-- Wrap the provided text in a paragraph tag -->
        <p>We offer BIOSCIENCE as major subject and BOTANY as a subsidiary subject. Biology Department of this college has full-fledged laboratory and committed teachers to undertake theory and practical teaching.<br>

Ours is perhaps the only college in South Gujarat which offer Bioscience at B.Sc. level. It covers Histology, Clinical biochemistry, Hematology along with medical microbiology.<br>

Bioscience course emphasize mostly on practical aspects and almost cover all tests routinely done in pathology lab.<br>

It is in fact a Para-medical course framed in a way that students become self- sufficient and get wider exposure after graduation as eligible technician for employment in Government or semi- govt. hospitals.<br>

Biology Department normally organizes study tours and work-shops, seminars etc. under Eco-club. Students can register themselves with nominal fee and take advantage of latest events going on in the field of Biology.<br>

Chemistry section is the biggest department with well furnished three laboratories and latest equipments with internet facilities.</p></div>
